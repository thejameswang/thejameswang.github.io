      Iâ€™m a current 3rd year CS major at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
      Iâ€™m terribly passionate about the intersection between technology and
      social good. Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing a career in product management
      because Iâ€™ve found itâ€™s the best way to reach my goals of making good

      <p>
        Iâ€™m a current 3rd year CS major at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
        Iâ€™m terribly passionate about the intersection between technology and
        social good. Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing a career in product management
        because Iâ€™ve found itâ€™s the best way to reach my goals of making good
        easier for everyone.

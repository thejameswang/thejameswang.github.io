# My personal website thejameswang.github.io 

## The Beginning
During the summer of 2017, I first started my quest of web development and computer science. I chose to create a personal website because it combines multiple skills that I would need to start on a Front-end Web development journey. Of course at that time, I didn't know what that meant. The goal was to create a website completely from scratch with an about me, contact me, experience, projects, and hobbies. Eventually, it would expand to include blog posts.

## The Journey 
Starting with code academy's HTML and CSS course, I learned the basics. From basic tags to advanced postioning, I learned the syntax of it all. But, I still felt lost at where to start. Finally, I discovered internetingishard.com. Their HTML and CSS tutorial provided very comprehensive steps on accomplishing my project. 

## Bugs and Issues: Resolved
1. Initially, my website used purely flexbox that remained unresponsive. My solution was to chance my entire site to use Bootstrap. Though now I understand the power behind flexbox, Bootstrap still does the job. I can still always change to the use of Flexbox together with Bootstrap.
2. JavaScript was only slightly introduced later to allow scrolling. JQuery was necessary for the smooth transitions. 
3. Design: The design is still unpolished, and it requires a revamp. If there are any ideas, please submit a PR!

						<p>I'm a second year college student, coder, photographer, and table tennis hobbyist. Currently, I'm a part-time Digital Technology Intern at General Electric Digital, but I'm also a college student at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Neuroscience and Computer Science are my cpassion, but presently, I'm focusing on my passion to be a software engineer.</p>
						<p>This website was the partial result of my inital passions. When I was younger, I was afraid of the <strong>different</strong>. After my junior year of high school, I changed my mentality completey. I had a *bug* to improve myself in every facet. Since then, I've accepted the chaos that naturally occurs with exploring the different; In fact, I'm avidly searching for it. This is a website for documenting that journey.</p>

				<h3><strong>Digital Technology and SRE Intern <em>Since</em> May 2018</strong></h3>
				<p>As apart of the Monitoring Team for Coretech Digital, I created a management system to assist BI analysis of monitor metadata and control usage. Working with New Relic and Sikuli monitoring, I developed a silencing system, allowing maintenance periods to be synonymous with our new in-house management system. I established a framework for future improvements such as Internal Self self-service portal, monitoring, and reporting. </p>
				<p>I created automation for disabling invalid and failing monitors as a cost saving effort (one quarter savings of 100K with continued savings).</p>

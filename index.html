						<p>I'm a freshman college student, coder, photographer, and table tennis hobbyist. Currently, I'm a Fellow at the Horizons School of Technology, but I'm also a college student at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Neuroscience and Computer Science is my passion, but presently, I'm focusing on my passion to be a software engineer.</p>
						<p>This website is the partial result of my recent passions. When I was younger, I was afraid of the <strong>different</strong>. After my junior year of high school, I changed my mentality completey. I had a *bug* to improve myself, academically, physically, and socially. Since then, I've accepted the chaos that naturally occurs with exploring the different; In fact, I'm avidly searching for it.</p>

										<p>The Junior Table Tennis Foundation is a non-profit table tennis that I led between 2014 to 2017. As president, I create events and tournaments for charity. As a non-profit, the organization under my lead has raised over $2000, and has donated to Relay for Life and the Police Athletic League. We also take time to give children without table tennis exposure to experience the chance to play through created events. We've had two throughout the year, and at the same time, we donated to them, PAL, a table for continual exposure. I've been in charge of finding sponsors, venues, and organizations to help, and the organization has increased its participation from contributors every year.</p>
